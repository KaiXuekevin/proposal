    "The COVID-19 outbreak has been a popular research topic among researchers in various fields. Physical and mental health issues of both society and individuals have been studied extensively. I have found that some of the behaviour in the outbreak seem to have a strong relationship with people's mental health.\n",

Regarding the selection of the variables under study, I will purposely select three sets of variables, one set of two categorical variables, one set of one categorical variable and one numerical variable, and one set of two numerical variables. Try to explore the relationship between them in different ways."

This approach helps to visualise the differences between the different groups.\n",

At the same time we can make an assumption about the relationship between the two variables to calculate the p-value.

The height of the colour bar for completely reduced socialisation is greatest among those who feel helpless a lot. The p-value is less than the level of significance (e.g. 0.05). So I think the two variables are related."

The people who are sick more often in the box plot should have lower happy stats for each, and correspondingly the people who are sick less often will have higher happy stats, but there is bound to be outlier among them.
